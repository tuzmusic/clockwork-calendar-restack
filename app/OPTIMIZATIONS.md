# Optimizations, Refinements, Refactoring

- [X] EventPart *class*
  - [X] Ceremony actualStart handled in subclass
- [X] EventTimeline(?) class, handles ordering events
  - [X] Also gets event start and end times?
- Location class, handles distances and stuff?
- Use start time when getting route info
- Better width/alignment in email html 
  - probably best to just construct it from data, with grid layout, and scrap the original html
